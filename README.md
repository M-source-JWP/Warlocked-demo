# Warlocked-demo
Code snippets from Warlocked, a top-down roguelike dungeon crawler I programmed with a team of 5 other students. 
-Diagrams of the "SkeletonAI" and "GoblinAI" behaviors are available in the included image
-Code for each node type, or how the trees traverse from behavior to behavior, is visible in the .h file
-Code for individual behaviors, as well as the construction of the trees for use in the game is visible in the .c file
